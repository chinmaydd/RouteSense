Sensor Nodes -> Base station

[*] Constructing a cost field starting at base station. 
[*] Base station has cost 0.
[*] Cost can represent application dependent metric: hop count, energy, latency,
loss, etc.
[*] Every node starts with a cost of infinity
[*] All nodes start converging to a minimum cost.
[*] Optimization: Delay rebroadcasting for a time proportional to link cost(?)
[*] Susceptible to Sinkhole
